                    I am a senior Computer Science student at Ramapo College of New Jersey with a zeal for software and web development. Having said that, nothing excites me more than coding for countless hours and sketching algorithms on the board with occasional coffee breaks. I am driven towards creativity and innovation. It has led me from innovating apps at various hackathons to founding clubs on campus to help cultivate new ideas. 

                    My passion for learning adventures motivates me to move outside the box when it comes to problem-solving and innovation. Besides computers, I also like to hike and have unique adventures that can make me curious.

                                            | I was a Secretary of ISO during my sophomore year. I introduced monthly ethnic cuisine and info sessions
                                            | on different international cultures where more than 15 students participated. I also co-sponsored the
                                            | club with many other cultural clubs on campus. Due to the increment in activities, the club budget increased by 100%
                                            | for the following year. I continued as the student advisor for the club next year where I advised 
                                            | club leaders on conducting cultural activities on campus.
